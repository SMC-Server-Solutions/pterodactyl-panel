# Pterodactyl Panel
Pterodactyl is an open-source game server management panel built with PHP 7, React, and Go. Designed with security 
in mind, Pterodactyl runs all game servers in isolated Docker containers while exposing a beautiful and intuitive
UI to end users.

Stop settling for less. Make game servers a first class citizen on your platform.
